A '''comparison of [[baseball]] and [[softball]]''' can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

[[Fastpitch softball]] is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational [[sports league|league]]s where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).
