! ARM Research Labs, LLC [http://www.gbudb.com/ GBUdb]

! Truncate

| [http://www.gbudb.com/truncate/]

| truncate.gbudb.net

| Extremely conservative list of single IP4 addresses that produce exclusively spam/malware as indicated by the GBUdb IP Reputation system. Most systems should be able to safely reject connections based on this list.

| Automatic: IPs are added when the GBUdb "cloud" statistics reach a probability figure that indicates 95% of messages produce a spam/malware pattern match and a confidence figure that indicates sufficient data to trust the probability data.

| Automatic: Continuous while reputation statistics remain bad. Warning: Produces false positives, and has no remedy/removal process. IPs are dropped quickly if the statistics improve (within an hour). IPs are dropped within 36 hours (typ) if no more messages are seen (dead zombie).

| Source data is derived from a global network of Message Sniffer filtering nodes in real-time. Truncate data is updated from statistics every 10 minutes.

Collateral listings are kept to a minimum because subsections are often carved from /24 listings when spammers and legit senders share the same /24 block.

| Automatic once at least several IP addresses from a given block are individually listed on ivmSIP, with extensive whitelists and filtering to prevent false positives

| expiration time increases to many weeks as the fraction of IP addresses in the /24 block in question sending junk mail increases

"Collateral Listings" - Blacklists IP addresses that do not send spam, in order to coerce ISPs to take action against spammers under their control.

"Notifies upon listing" - Warns the owner of the IP/Domain when they list an IP (so owners can take action to fix the problem)
