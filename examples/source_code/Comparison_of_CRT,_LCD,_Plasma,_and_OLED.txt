|Ghosting and smearing
|No ghosting or smearing artifacts;<br>slightly blurry;<br>halo may appear around objects with high contrast to background 
|Display motion blur on models with slow response time, and the elimination technique (strobing backlight) can cause eye-strain
|None even during fast motion, advancements in 3D have eliminated phosphor trailing due to the use of fast-switching phosphors
|None even during fast motion

|Flicker and eyestrain
|Part of the screen always lit during refreshes;<br>flicker noticeable at refresh rates below 85&nbsp;Hz
|Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]] ([[Strobe light|strobing]]) to dim the backlight which can cause severe eyestrain for some people although the flicker isn't visible because it is normally done at 200&nbsp;Hz or faster
|Poor due to phosphor based but improving in newer models
|Part of the screen always lit during refreshes due to [[Multiplexed display|multiplexing]]

||Compact, <br>can be manufactured almost any size and shape, <br>very thin allowing mounted distance to user for less focusing-related eyestrain

|Screen burn-in
|Yes, the reason [[screensavers]] became popular

|Other
|No [[native resolution]]. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). [[Display lag]] is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.
|The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality. <br>Many newer models are powered by an external 12V power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space
|Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes;<br>fragile and required to be upright to avoid screen collapse
|No backlight needed, <br>can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates for flexible displays
