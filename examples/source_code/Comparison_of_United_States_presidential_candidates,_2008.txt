The third party candidates' tax plans were not studied by mainstream media outlets and the Tax Policy Center.  Chuck Baldwin supports replacing the income tax with a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods.  Bob Barr supports replacing the income tax with a [[consumption tax]] (the [[FairTax]]).  The details of his exact plan are not known but consumption taxes tend to be [[Regressive tax|regressive]] unless accompanied by a [[Minimum wage#Negative income tax|negative income tax]] for the poor to offset necessary expenditures.  Cynthia McKinney supports sharply [[progressive taxation]], with higher taxes for the rich and a tax cut for the middle class.

This would include: formally and clearly end the bailouts which promote private economic retrenchment and corporate work-outs; limiting powers of the government to place sustained federal pressure to increase mortgage lending, through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; amending or revoking the [[Community Reinvestment Act]]; limiting the ability of the Federal Reserve to manipulate the currency for political purposes; Ensuring enforcement of the SEC regulations to insure solvency and transparency in the operation of major investment firms; Permanently lowering tax rates and simplifying taxes to more effectively reinforce long-term plans for hiring, inventory and production; cutting environmental rules such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards on vehicles; initiating a detailed audit of federal rules, relaxing or eliminating any regulations for which costs outweigh benefits; reducing penalties on people for delayed tax payments and premature withdrawals from IRAs; ending nonessential federal spending, particularly frivolous special interest outlays; Over the longer term, evaluate, plan, and implement for future federal liabilities and obligations—FDIC bank guarantees, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation promises, Social Security and Medicare liabilities, and more.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Opposed $700&nbsp;billion bailout to Wall Street. Instead offered a 14-point proposal which included a moratorium on foreclosures; elimination of all ARM mortgages and their renegotiation into 30- or 40-year loans; the establishment of new mortgage lending practices to end predatory and discriminatory practices; the establishment of criteria and construction goals for affordable housing; a redefinition of credit and regulation of the credit industry so that discriminatory practices are completely eliminated; full funding for initiatives that eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in home ownership; recognition of shelter as a right according to the UN Declaration of Human Rights; targeting of funds to cushion job loss and provide for retraining of those at the bottom of the income scale as the economy transitions; the closure all tax loopholes and repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the top 1% of income earners; fair taxation of corporations, denial of federal subsidies to those who relocate jobs overseas repeal NAFTA; the appointment of former Comptroller General David Walker to fully audit all recipients of taxpayer cash infusions, including JP Morgan, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, and to monitor their trading activities into the future; the elimination of all derivatives trading; the nationalization of the Federal Reserve; and the establishment of a federally owned, public banking system that makes credit available for small businesses, homeowners, manufacturing operations, renewable energy and infrastructure investments; and criminally prosecute any activities that violated the law, including conflicts of interest that led to the current crisis.

| colspan="2" width="50%" |McCain is a strong proponent of [[free trade]].  He supports the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the existing [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], and U.S. participation in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).  He opposes including labor and environmental conditions to trade agreements.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Obama supports expanding trade only if the United States' trade partners place labor and environmental standards on their industries to "level the playing field" for American interests.  If elected President, Obama plans to renegotiate NAFTA to include stricter labor and environmental standards for Canada and Mexico. He has criticized the current agreement for not including such standards, and he also voted against and criticized the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) for similar reasons.
|-

|-valign="top"
|Baldwin would lead the US out of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American]] and the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]]s. He would impose a revenue [[tariff]].
|Barr's campaign site states that America "should encourage private involvement around the world, particularly through free trade. The most effective way to preserve peace is through an expanding free market, backed by a full range of cultural and other private relationships".
|McKinney stresses enacting laws on US corporations to keep labor standards high at home and raise them abroad. She would repeal NAFTA ([[North American Free Trade Agreement]]), CAFTA, the Caribbean FTA, and US-Peru FTA. She opposes the guest-worker program as riddled with abuses; supports justice for immigrant workers, and immigrant reform that includes amnesty and a path to legalization for undocumented people who have been living and working in the US for years.
|Nader views NAFTA and the WTO as subverting national regulatory agencies. He blames them for diminishing standards of living (i.e. [[race to the bottom]]). Nader supports a constitutional amendment asserting the "sovereignty of people over the power of corporations."

| colspan="2" width="50%" |McCain favors tax credits of up to $5,000 for families that purchase health insurance. "We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage or costs." His plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 1 million by 2009 and 5&nbsp;million by 2013, while raising the national debt by $1.3&nbsp;trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Obama's health care plan includes implementing guaranteed eligibility for affordable health care for all Americans. His plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 18 million by 2009 and 34&nbsp;million by 2018, covering nearly all children, while raising the national debt by $1.6&nbsp;trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate.

|Co-sponsored every bill in Congress to create a system of [[universal health care]] under a [[single-payer health care|single payer]] model. Opposes forced, coerced, or uninformed medication and sterilization; believes Americans should be able to purchase drugs from other countries if the price is cheaper, and the U.S. should negotiate with drug companies to provide cheaper drugs for all U.S. residents.

===Taxation and budget deficit===

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="2" |John McCain
! colspan="2" |Barack Obama
|-valign="top"
| colspan="2" width="25%" |While McCain has historically favored deficit reduction over tax cuts, he has pledged not to rescind recent tax cuts in combination with reduced spending. McCain believes that lower taxes will stimulate the economy, and that the current deficit owes more to overspending than to tax cuts.  McCain plans to balance the budget by the end of his first term. According to the Tax Policy Center, McCain's tax plans (by extending the Bush tax cuts and cutting corporate tax rates from 35% to 25% to increase investment, among other measures), would increase the national debt by nearly $5&nbsp;trillion over 10 years, a nearly 50% increase.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Obama advocates responding to the "precarious budget situation" by eliminating "tax credits that have outlived their usefulness", closing corporate tax loopholes, and restoring the [[PAYGO]] policy that prohibits increases in federal spending without a way to compensate for the lost revenue. Obama proposes extending the Bush tax cuts for low- and middle-income families, while letting taxes go back up for individuals earning over $200,000 or couples earning over $250,000.

|Barr supports repealing the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] and mentions the [[Fair Tax]] as a possible alternative. "Meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending."
|Would repeal Bush tax cuts for top 1% of income earners; close tax loopholes; tax corporations more; and deny federal subsidies to those who relocate jobs overseas.  Proposes to regain control of the monetary system and respond to the current economic crisis, by steps that include a moratorium on foreclosures; elimination of all ARM mortgages and their renegotiation into 30- or 40-year loans; establishment of new mortgage lending practices to end predatory and discriminatory practices; funds targeted at cushioning job loss and retraining of those at the bottom of the income scale as the economy transitions; appointment of former Comptroller General David Walker to fully audit all recipients of taxpayer cash infusions, including JP Morgan, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, and to monitor their trading activities into the future; elimination of all derivatives trading; nationalization of the Federal Reserve and the establishment of a federally owned, public banking system that makes credit available for small businesses, homeowners, manufacturing operations, renewable energy, and infrastructure investments; criminal prosecution of any conflicts of interest that led to the current crisis.
|Nader opposes [[corporate welfare]] and seeks to end corporate loopholes, exemptions, credits, accelerated depreciation schedules, deductions, and targeted exceptions. He would balance the national budget by cutting military spending by $100&nbsp;billion, or about a fifth, and through sharply [[progressive taxation]].

===Social Security===

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="2" |John McCain
! colspan="2" |Barack Obama
|-valign="top"
| colspan="2" width="50%" |In June 1999, McCain said "The only way to increase the yield on Social Security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest, in most robust portfolios, a portion of their earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security." In January 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating private Social Security accounts. Partial privatization, or diverting payroll taxes to private accounts, would reduce available funds for current retirees significantly, requiring large debt increases to cover the transition.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Obama has said that Social Security's funding problem is "real but manageable." He has proposed to fund Social Security by applying payroll taxes to individual income above $250,000 per year, and says that these high-income earners should "pay their fair share." When asked if he would consider raising the retirement age or cutting benefits, Obama did not rule these approaches out entirely, saying, "everything should be on the table."  However, he has said that he would not push for either of those approaches, and says that an increase in tax revenue is necessary to stabilize the system. Obama opposes adding personal accounts to Social Security.

|Phase out Social Security.
|Social security is not sustainable. Social Security should be changed to an "individualized system of private accounts."
|McKinney strongly opposes privatizing Social Security, and recognizes cuts disproportionately harm women. She believes tax payments on benefits should be reduced, and benefits increased. 
|Nader views Social Security as "government as it should work – a coming together of society to ensure that we, as a community, take care of each other as we age or suffer from disabilities." Nader opposes a privatized system that would replace "systemic tranquility with an enforced anxiety". He says people are already able to take risk in the stock market through [[Individual Retirement Account|IRA]]s, [[401K]]s and other tax-subsidized private retirement devices.

Obama and other Senators introduced a bill in 2007 to promote the development of commercially viable [[plug-in hybrids]] and other electric-drive vehicles in order to shift away from petroleum fuels and "toward much cleaner – and cheaper – electricity for transportation". In his plan, related with transportation, he proposes  increase [[fuel economy standard]]s 4 percent per each year, specific focus on R&D in advanced battery technology and a $7,000 [[tax credit]] for the purchase of advanced technology vehicles as well as conversion tax credits and $4&nbsp;billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers; the entire White House fleet would be converted to plug-ins and half of cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in (hybrids or all-electric) vehicles by 2012.

In his bid for the 2000 Presidential nomination, McCain supported expansion of the [[H-1B visa]] program, a temporary visa for skilled workers. In 2005, he co-sponsored a bill with [[Ted Kennedy]] that would expand use of guest worker visas.
| colspan="2" width="50%" |Obama's plan: 1) Improve border security; 2) Crack down on employers who hire illegal immigrants; 3) Enable immigrants in the country illegally to voluntarily pay a fine, learn English, and get in line for legal citizenship; 4) Fix the immigration bureaucracy; and 5) Provide additional economic assistance to Mexico. Obama also supports issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants to prevent unlicensed drivers from creating a public safety hazard.

|Baldwin would enforce visa rules, and does not support a "path to citizenship"/amnesty for aliens currently residing in the US illegally. Employers who knowingly hire illegals would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Would end "birthright citizenship", and thus end the problem of "[[anchor babies]]". No federal monies would be used for any services to illegal aliens.
|Supports better border security to crack down on illegal immigration while also supporting reforms that will "sharply increase" legal immigration. Supports ending birthright citizenship and ending government benefits and services for illegal immigrants.
|McKinney believes the wave of new immigration is a result of economic policies and agreements (e.g., NAFTA) that impoverish people and drive them across borders. She opposes the guest-worker program as riddled with abuses, and support human rights protections and amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally, an end to raids, and tearing down the border wall.
|Nader does not support [[open border]]s, which he says will create a "cheap-wage policy" for businesses. He supports giving illegal workers, who have their taxes withheld, the same labor standards and benefits as American workers. He says the government should "crack down" on employers and stop "[[brain drain]]ing" Third World countries with [[H-1B visas]].
