'''Comparison''' is a feature in the [[grammar]] of some [[language]]s, whereby [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] or modified to produce forms which indicate the relative degree of the designated properties.

The [[grammatical category]] associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is '''degree of comparison'''. The usual degrees of comparison are the '''positive''', which simply denotes a property (as with the [[English grammar|English]] words ''big'' and ''fully'');  the '''[[comparative]]''', which indicates greater degree (as ''bigger'' and ''more fully''); and the '''[[superlative]]''', which indicates greatest degree (as ''biggest'' and ''most fully''). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] in Semitic linguistics).

==Formation of comparatives and superlatives==
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], by inflection, as with the English and [[German grammar|German]] ''-er'' and ''-(e)st'' forms, or [[syntax|syntactically]], as with the English ''more...'' and ''most...'' and the [[French grammar|French]] ''plus...'' and ''le plus...'' forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as ''better'' and ''best'' (from ''good'') and ''less'' and ''least'' (from ''little/few'') in English, and ''meilleur'' (from ''bon'') and ''mieux'' (from the adverb ''bien'') in French.

==Comparative and superlative constructions==
Comparatives are often used with a [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with ''than'' in English, ''als'' in German, etc. In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] this can be done by placing the compared noun in the [[genitive]] case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in ''the best swimmer out of all the girls''.

Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include ''as...as'' and ''less/least...'

==Usage when considering only two things==

In many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, ''May the better man win'' would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form ''May the best man win'' will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.

== Rhetorical use of unbalanced comparatives ==

In some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common [[rhetorical]] device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes [[Linguistic prescription|considered ungrammatical]].

For example:
* Always!
* Why pay more?
* We work harder.
* We sell for less!
* More doctors recommend it.

==Comparison in English==
[[English language|English]], because of the complex [[etymology]] of its [[lexicon]], has two parallel systems of comparison. One involves the [[suffix]]es ''-er'' (the "[[comparative]]") and ''-est'' (the "[[superlative]]"). These inflections are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, and are [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] suffixes -''ior'' and -''issimus'' and even closer [[Ancient Greek]] -''īōn'' and -''istos''. They are typically added to shorter words, words of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, and borrowed words that have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words that take these [[inflection]]s have fewer than three syllables. Despite these general trends, many adjectives can take either form, with different frequencies according to context.


This system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like ''good'', ''better'', ''best'', contain [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms.  These irregular forms include:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| good || better || best
|-
| well || better || best
|-
| bad || worse || worst
|-
| ill || worse || worst
|-
| far || farther || farthest
|-
| far || further || furthest
|-
| little || smaller, less(er) || smallest, least
|-
| many, much || more || most
|}

===''More'' and ''most''===
The second system of comparison in English appends the [[grammatical particle]]s ''more'' and ''most'', themselves the irregular comparatives of ''many''/''much'', to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the [[diminutive]]s ''less'' and ''least''.

This system is most commonly used with words of [[French language|French]] or [[Latin]] derivation; adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than ''-ly'' (e.g. ''beautiful''); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. Knowing which words fall into which system is a highly idiomatic issue in English [[syntax]]. Some words require the suffixing system: e.g. ''taller'' is required; *''more tall'' is not idiomatic English. 

Some words (e.g. ''difficult'') require ''more'' and ''most''. Some words (e.g. ''polite'') can be used with either system; curiously, while ''polite'' can go either way, the derived word ''impolite'' requires ''more'' and ''most''. 

The general rule is that words with one [[syllable]] require the suffix, words with three or more syllables require ''more'' or ''most'' and words with two syllables can go either way.

===Absolute adjectives===
A perennial issue in [[English usage]] involves the comparison of so-called "absolute" adjectives, also called [[ungradable adjective]]s, which logically do not seem to admit of comparison. There are many such adjectives — generally adjectives that name qualities that are either ''present'' or ''absent'': nothing is *"more Cretaceous" or *"more igneous" than anything else. 

Other examples include ''perfect'', ''unique'', and ''parallel'', which name qualities that are inherently superlative: if something is perfect, there can be nothing better, so it does not make sense to describe one thing as *"more perfect" than something else; if something is unique, in the sense of "one of a kind", something cannot be *"very unique", or *"more unique" than something else. See also [[tautology (rhetoric)]] and [[pleonasm]].

In general, terms like ''perfect'' and ''parallel'' cannot ever apply ''exactly'' to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean ''nearly perfect'', ''nearly parallel'', and so on; and in this (inexact) use, ''more perfect'' (i.e., more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and ''more parallel'' (i.e., more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) do seem to make sense.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|<span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2012)">citation needed</span>]]</i>&#93;</sup>

==Comparison in Balto-Slavic languages==
In most Balto-Slavic (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian etc.) the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives. The exception is [[Russian language|Russian]].
